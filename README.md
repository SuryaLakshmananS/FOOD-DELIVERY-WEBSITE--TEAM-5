# FOOD DELIVERY WEBSITE  TEAM-5 
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION : 
The objective of this project is to design and develop a food delivery website that allows users to order food from local restaurants and have it delivered to their doorstep. The website will have multiple features to facilitate the user experience, such as menu browsing, filtering options, order tracking, and payment processing.

The website will have two types of users: customers and restaurant owners. Customers will be able to browse through the menus of different restaurants and add their preferred dishes to their shopping cart. They will also be able to filter their search results based on various criteria such as cuisine type, price range, and proximity. Once the order is confirmed, customers can track the status of their order, from preparation to delivery. They will also have the option to pay for their orders online or in person upon delivery.

Restaurant owners will be able to create their profile on the website and upload their menus, pricing, and images. They will be able to manage their orders, view customer reviews, and respond to feedback. They will also have access to analytics such as sales reports, order history, and customer data.

The website will be built using modern web development technologies and will be optimized for mobile and desktop devices. The website will also have a user-friendly interface and a responsive design that provides an intuitive and seamless user experience. The website will also have features for user authentication, data security, and privacy protection.

Overall, the food delivery website project aims to provide a convenient and hassle-free way for customers to order food from their favorite restaurants, while also providing restaurant owners with an efficient way to manage their online presence and attract more customers.
